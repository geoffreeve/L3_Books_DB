*** CC Showcase ***

This folder includes the text and sources for the images used in this project.

The images in the 'insects', 'people' and 'space' folders have been resized.  You can access the original pages via the URLs on the 'supplied_image_sources.txt' file.

You should source at least three images from Wikimedia Commons yourself and resize / optimise them appropriately.  

You have been provided with a *very* basic template which is missing some of the required folders.  It includes the Jquery and fontawesome files (css / fonts).
