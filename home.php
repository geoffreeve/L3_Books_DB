        <h2>Creative Commons - The Mission!</h2>
        <p>
            Creative Commons gives content creators and consumers a way to share 
            works without needing to grant permission for work to be used each time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of creative commons is to "overcome legal obstacles to the sharing of knowledge and creativity to address the worldâ€™s pressing challenges".
